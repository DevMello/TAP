# 3 Steps to Pro WebRTC for Beginners

WebRTC today is deep and invovled with many subtleties which are easy to miss.  We built a WebRTC SDK which solves these challenges and will allow you to become a Pro **WebRTC app developer**.  In three easy steps you'll find yourself with the key basics for building business ready WebRTC applications.

 1. Get PubNub Keys
 1. Create a Dialer and Call Receiver GUI
 1. Add JavaScript WebRTC SDK
 

## WebRTC SDP and ICE Packets

Usually when you are building with WebRTC from bare JavaScript, you will need to invent a way to both generate and broadcast two different types of payloads.  **SDP and ICE packets** are descriptor packets which explain to your computer a way to communicate over an internet route.  The first road block is generating the packets.  Once you've generated SPD and ICE, you will need a signalling system like PubNub to exchange these packets between two peers.

 - webrtc is hard
 - but it shouldn't be
 - that is why we created WebRTC SDK that is production ready.
 - you'll learn how to build WebRTC Apps in less than 30 minutes.
